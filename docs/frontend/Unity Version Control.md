# Unity Version Control

- Unity's own solution for managing Unity projects.
- Previously known as "Plastic SCM".
- Part of the "Unity DevOps Version Control" application.
- Works directly within Unity.
    - ...or via the external "Gluon" application.   
- Paid after three users.
- Project size limited to 5GB.
- Uses a "locking system", meaning a file is locked to a specific member who is working on it.
    - A more refined system than "flagging in Discord".
- For the EEICT project, this would serve as an additional repository alongside the one on GitHub.
